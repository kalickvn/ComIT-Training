# üß© CSS Containers

Time to create an events page on the web!

## üèÅ STEPS

1. Follow AND read the following HTML guide: [HTML GUIDE](https://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html5_syntax.asp)

2. Your task is to create the same design on the web as follows:

![events-page](./design/events.png)<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è **_NOTE_**: You can find the design image under `/design` folder in the root directory.<br>

3. Create any necessary files for your project. Ex. `index.html` and any other files/folders required in this project `root folder`. <br>

4. The image you need can be found under folder `/images`.
5. Other than the required elements seen in class, your website **MUST** include the following elements:

```html
<!-- A page title -->
<title></title>

<!-- Headings-->
<h1></h1>
<h2></h2>

<!-- Text styles like:-->
<b></b>
<i></i>

<!-- Lists -->
<ul></ul>
<li></li>

<!-- Link -->
<a></a>

<!-- image -->
<img />

<!-- Sections -->
<section></section>

<!-- new element -->
<small></small>

<!-- Divs -->
<div></div>
```

6. Do not forget about some useful `CSS`. If you do not know a property from the following list, a good **_Google Search_** might get you there.<br>

- Give the **_right_** names to your `classes`. Ex. `top-box`, `bottom-box`, `computer-hardware-container`, `microsoft-patch-container` `time-hour`, `event-type`, etc. Based on the content, provide names.

> [!WARNING]
> The following properties are the only ones allowed for this challenge. Read carefully!

```CSS
   body {
      font-family: "Segoe UI";
      font-weight: /* 300, 500 or 700 */;
   }

   #selector {
      margin: auto;
      width: /* value can be in px or percentage */;
      padding: /* Great use case for having space around the content */;
      border-radius: /* what do you think this might help you do in the border? ü§î*/;
   }

   img {
      display: block; /* What is this property doing to the image or any other element? üí≠ */;
   }

   #box {
        display: flex /* This is not allowed in your challenge */;
   }
```
